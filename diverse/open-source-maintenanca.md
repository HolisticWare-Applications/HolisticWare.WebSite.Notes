Question:

1.  closed source and wait for announcement about product discontinuation?

2.  open source w/o active maintenance?

I prefer 2.

In 2015/2016 when Google announced mandatory Native UI support for OAuth I was using Xamarin.Auth on several
personal side projects. At that point Xamarin.Auth had no official maintainers and owners. I had 2 options -
to sob or to roll up my sleeves and add support for Native UI. Xamarin.Auth is open source
