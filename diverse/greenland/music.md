My daddy was a minor. Hoped I'd break
0:03
the curse. Now I'm stuck in Greenland,
0:05
going from bad to worse. They said, "Had
0:08
north, son, it's America's chance. Pays
0:10
all right if you don't mind the dance.
0:13
Left her with the kids and a pile of
0:15
debt. Promised  her
0:17
pay like she hasn't seen yet. They flew
0:20
us like cattle in a C130 plane, watching
0:22
every last hole go right down
0:25
the drain.
0:27
Greenland. Oh, Greenland. What sin did
0:31
we ever do
0:33
to end up suffering under your sky so
0:38
blue?
0:40
Green little
0:42
green land. You cold
0:44
hearted sun.
0:46
Digging
0:47
for minerals, fingers black and gone.
0:57
It's minus 65 grease hard as stone. Even the devil turn back and go
1:02
home. My toes fell off
1:04
early. They're lost in the drift. I'm
1:06
walking on stumps for the 12-hour shift
1:09
with fermented seal with beans frozen
1:12
through. Piss turns to ice
1:14
before it hits the shoe. The locals are
1:16
cursing. No welcome inside cuz we're
1:19
hauling up  their
1:20
ancestors day and night.
1:25
Green
1:26
land. Oh, green land. What sin
1:29
did we ever do
1:31
to end up suffering under
1:34
your sky
1:35
soul?
1:38
Green land. Oh, green
1:40
land. You cold hearted son.
1:44
Digging for minerals. Fingers
1:48
 black and gone.
2:02
The boss man flies in on a private jet wing 
to see how much money our misery can bring. 
Doesn't stay long. Won't look in our eyes. 
Tells us know your place boys or pay the price.
He slips back to DC by the break of dawn. 
Banging young interns while our hope is all gone. 
We keep on digging like they told us to. 
But the only hole we finish is a place to sh17 into.
2:32
Greenland. Oh,  green
2:35
land. What sin did we ever do
2:38
to end up breaking our backs under
2:41
 skies so blue?
2:45
Greenland. Oh, green land. You
2:48
swallowed us whole,
2:51
left us digging our graves in
2:54
the ice
2:56
[music]
2:56
and snow.
