# Freelance platform comparison

Freelance platform comparison tools like 

https://developersforhire.com 

are helpful when you aren't sure which one to choose. These tools are usually free and don't require you to sign up for 
an account, so you'll have peace of mind about the website you choose.

Websites like 
    ZipRecruiter 
and 
    Upwork 

will give you a long list of candidates. Keep in mind that they do little to no pre-vetting. The automated vetting systems they 
use don't single out the best talent and are often too lenient. Toptal supports and showcases the best freelancers around the world. 

If you need talented remote developers, 

    Toptal 
    
is probably the best choice for you.
