# Employment


middle age

    every advantage will be turned into a disadvantage
    

    experience will be re-phrased as being “overqualified” 
    
        actually means that you will probably have an established opinion, making you less malleable.

    age will be seen as a weakness, both physically and psychologically

And last but certainly not least: you’ll cost them more compared to younger applicants.
