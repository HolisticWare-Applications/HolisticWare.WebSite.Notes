        The Formula has infinite depth in its efficacy and application. 
        
        Rule 1 : You can only get smarter by playing a smarter opponent.

        Rule 2 : The more sophisticated the game - the more sophisticated the opponent. If the 
        opponent is very good, he will place his victim inside an environment he can control.

        Rule 3 : You will always find a good opponent in the very last place you would ever look.
