What can the armed forces teach business?⁠
⁠
Given the long history of blunders in warfare (such as friendly-fire incidents), it may seem 
odd to turn to the military for tips on efficiency.⁠
⁠
But many a corporate titan has sought wisdom in the philosophies of strategists like Sun Tzu 
and Carl von Clausewitz. And military expertise in emergencies was exploited by the British 
government to help build “Nightingale hospitals” early in the covid-19 pandemic.⁠
⁠
Corporate executives know their own business really well. But when the environment changes, 
experience counts for less.⁠
⁠
In contrast, the military prepares for situations of uncertainty and complexity. During a pandemic, 
this approach can offer useful insights for businesses.⁠
