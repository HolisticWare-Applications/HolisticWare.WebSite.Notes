.NET Clean Architecture, but for Microservices project
.NET 6 Preview 5 has recently released with a lot of significant improvements compared to .NET 5 
(already very good in features and performance boost) üëç

For testing and learning purposes, I build a set of simple libraries in the direction of 
Clean Architecture + DDD + CQRS as well as a demo application with full components for Microservices architecture including core services (product-api, customer-api, and settings-api), API Gateway (YARP), IdentityServer, and Blazor Web App. In addition, the application is also packaged as a Docker container 
and runs with Tye on Dapr (Kubernetes) üëç

I share here for those of you who want to learn and play new things in the .NET world like me. 
For a strong .NET community. Check it out üëâ https://github.com/thangchung/clean-architecture-dotnet
