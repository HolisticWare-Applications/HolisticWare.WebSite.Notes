# Azure Machine Learning Studio

azure-machine-learning-studio.md

Microsoft's Azure Machine Learning Studio has an "always free" tier, subject to certain limitations, including

*   100 modules per experiment (a "module" in Azure-speak is any discrete operation such as "load data" or "train model", so you can do quite a bit with 100 of them)

*   10Gb of storage

*   1 hour per experiment

*   No parallel execution on multiple nodes

Cloud ML providers

*   AWS

    *   If specifically deep learning on a large data set, then probably AWS is out - their free offer
        does not cover machines with enough processing power to tackle deep learning projects.

*   Google Cloud

    *   might do, the starting credit offer is good enough to do a little deep learning (for maybe a couple
        of weeks), although they have signup and tax restrictions.

*   Azure have a free tier with limited processing and storage options.
