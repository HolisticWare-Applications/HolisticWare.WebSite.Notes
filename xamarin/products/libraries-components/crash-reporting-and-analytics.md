## AppCenter (Xamarin.Insights)

*   https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/appcenter/sdk/

*   https://appcenter.ms/

AppCenter is Microsofts own framework providing 

    *   crash reporting, 
    
    *   logging, 
    
    *   push notifications, 
    
    *   analytics, 
    
    *   building, 
    
    *   distribution (
        
        *   update push notifications

It used to be called HockeyApp, then MobilityCenter, and has changed name again and merged 
Xamarin Insights into MobilityCenter. 

*   supports 

    *   Xamarin.Forms 
    
        (Android, iOS, UWP) 
    *   as well as traditional/native Android and IOS; 
    
however, documentation is somewhat confusing as the UWP does not come always as supported or fully supported.

One strange requirement is to not use any other reporting packages if using AppCenter
