# Xamarin.Studio with Xamarin.Android on Linux


android emulator *requires* KVM for x86 to work (AMD or Intel, user might 
need to enable it in your system firmware, then install a package to load the 
KVM drivers at boot)

3D acceleration in the android emulator is only tested on intel & nvidia 
(ought to work with radeon mesa, but unlikely with radeon amdgpupro)
