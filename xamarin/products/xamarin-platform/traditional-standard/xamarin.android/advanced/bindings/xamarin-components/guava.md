```
"D:\X\GPS-FB-ax\samples\all\BuildAll.sln" (Build target) (1) ->
"D:\X\GPS-FB-ax\samples\all\FbAll\FbBuildAll.csproj" (default target) (3) ->
(_CompileToDalvikWithD8 target) ->
  R8 : error : Program type already present: com.google.common.util.concurrent.ListenableFuture [D:\X\GPS-FB-ax\samples\all\FbAll\FbBuildAll.csproj]
```

The root cause to change ReferenceJar to EmbeddedReferenceJar was following R8 error during build of 
samples for AndroidX:

```
R8 : warning : Missing class: java.lang.ClassValue [/Users/Shared/Projects/d/X/AndroidX-updates_202002/samples/BuildAll/BuildAll/BuildAll.csproj]
8 : error : Compilation can't be completed because some library classes are missing. [/Users/Shared/Projects/d/X/AndroidX-updates_202002/samples/BuildAll/BuildAll/BuildAll.csproj]
```

Changing ReferenceJar to EmbeddedReferenceJar solved that issue. Why? No idea. I haven't had time to dig deeper into that.

In the meantime I found that java.lang.ClassValue is in java/kotlin world solved by proguard rules:

```
-dontwarn java.lang.ClassValue
```

The problem is that those errors pop out in different "stages" (branches) of the AndroidX and GPS-FB bindings, which map to 
update at some specific date-time and if tooling changes (IDE or Xamarin.Android updates) it can happend that I cannot 
reproduce that.



GPS-FB with AndroidX dependencies:

Building ci target fails with:

```
R8 : error : Program type already present: com.google.common.util.concurrent.ListenableFuture 
[D:\X\GPS-FB-ax\samples\all\FbAll\FbBuildAll.csproj]
```

Opening sample[s] GpsBuildAll and FbBuildAll in IDE and buid them ends with 100 ACW errors about missing 
classes and packages:

This 2nd one is confusing with respect to "missing packages" and they are there!?!?

I talked with Jon a bit about Guava problem, so we went through the PR/commits you did and my bindings.
In this comment is what he suggests:
https://github.com/xamarin/GooglePlayServicesComponents/issues/317#issuecomment-613526574
But we are (he is) not sure that this would work.
Just as suggestion/idea.

Comment on #317 GPS + FB Build All samples with Cake script - R8 ACW error (sample built with Cake 
script `ci` target or `samples` target)

```
  R8 : error : Program type already present: com.google.common.util.concurrent.ListenableFuture [D:\X\GPS-FB-ax\samples\all\FbAll\FbBuildAll.csproj]
```

I believe the problem is caused by an App project referencing both the `Xamarin.Google.Guava.ListenableFuture` 
and `Xamarin.Google.Guava` NuGet packages, which each provide the com.google.common.util.concurrent.ListenableFuture 
type.

A solution is a variation of Don't Do Thatâ„¢: if both packages are provided, only one of the .jar files should 
actually be referenced.
How do we do that?
A possible solution would be to update Xamarin.Google.Guava.targets within the Xamarin.Google.Guava NuGet so that 
it sets a $(_HaveFullGuava) property:



*   jonp thought of one little complication with using a property was that the order of 
    NuGet package imports might change the results. So he was brainstorming that 
    
*   another way could be to use a target with `BeforeTargets="$(_CompileJavaDependsOnTargets)"` in 
    the Guava NuGet package to check for an remove the listenable-future library in cases where an 
    app references both. 
    Brendan will try to play with that approach a little later this week, hopefully around Thursday, 
    if that sounds good.

That crossed my mind tooâ€¦
Maybe we should/could talk to Peppers.
We donâ€™t need less than ideal solution/workaround.

Sounds good. One other idea I had was if it's worth trying to use the same trick Google uses

Miljenko Cvjetko ðŸ‡­ðŸ‡·:house_with_garden:  19:05
Sounds great for me. Iâ€™d like to do it myself, but I want to catch up with GPS-FB stuff.

worth trying to use the same trick Google uses
Proguard?

Brendan Zagaeski:slack_call:  19:05
Where they have a different package version for listenable-future that is just an empty Maven package for the case where the app also references the full Guava
19:06
So maybe we could make Xamarin.Google.Guava depend on a specific empty-package version of listenable-future

Miljenko Cvjetko ðŸ‡­ðŸ‡·:house_with_garden:  19:06
How would we do that?
19:06
I asked once in Components team, but we never come to conclusionâ€¦
19:06
they have something like 9999.99
19:06
right?


*   that wouldn't stop users from referencing a specific version of listenable-future directly 
    in their apps, so maybe it's not the ideal solution either

more brainstorming :slightly_smiling_face: I'll plan to chat with Peppers too and loop you in

You don't specify in what way it doesn't work. Your configuration keeps the names of all public classes in the specified package:

```
-keep public class com.myapp.customcomponents.*
```

The following configuration keeps the names of all public classes in the specified package and its subpackages:

```
-keep public class com.myapp.customcomponents.**
```

The following configuration keeps the names of all public/protected classes/fields/methods in the specified package and its subpackages:

```
-keep public class com.myapp.customcomponents.** {
  public protected *;
}
```
