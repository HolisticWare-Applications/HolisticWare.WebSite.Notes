## Xamarin is Hybrid

## Xamarin is about the same API (accross platforms)

Very few companies create mobile apps for
    *   Android with java
    *   iOS with objective-c or swift 
with common API in mind during design time!!

### Samples    

### Spotify

*   Android
    *   com.spotify.sdk.android.authentication
    *   com.spotify.jni
    *   com.spotify.jni.annotations
    *   com.spotify.sdk.android.player
*   iOS
    *   SpotifyAudioPlayback.framework
