    *   Commendments


        1.  Thou shalt never upgrade a react native version without at least having 72 hours of dedicated time.

        2.  When you can't figure out what's wrong then delete node_modules, delete Pods, delete DerivedData, delete cache, and rebuild everything.

        3.  Something running perfectly on ios has a 50% chance of being laggy on android.

        4.  Every library added to your project will break your build at some point in the future.

        5.  Never install a library that hasn't been updated in the last 6 3 months.

        6.  The answer to your question is in a closed github issue.

        7.  Don't be afraid to get into the native code and make changes.

        8.  Native code is a frightening place, only make changes as a last resort.

        9.  If you close your eyes before running a build command it has a 25% higher chance of building successfully.

        10. All changes made to the native build systems will be forgotten until it breaks your build at a later date.
