 without AOT, is it possible to reduce floating point precision in Xamarin.Android, 
 similar to 
 
    --aot-options=-O=float32` 

on IOS (but again, without AOT (still trying to figure out why the customer is so 
anti-AOT but that is a different battle))

Not sure if there is a mono runtime environment setting for that... so probably not.
