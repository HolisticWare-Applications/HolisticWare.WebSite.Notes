# El Captain Update 

After update 2015-12-20 of El Capitan some of java apps do not start, i.e.
Android Studio.


Opening the apps from the command line gives this error: 

    $ open /Applications/Android\ Studio.app
    LSOpenURLsWithRole() failed with error -600 for the file /Applications/Android Studio.app.    
    
Works:

    /Applications/Android\ Studio.app/Contents/MacOS/studio
