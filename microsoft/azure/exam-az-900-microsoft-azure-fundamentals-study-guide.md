*   high availability

    cloud application design (architecture) maximizes accessibility

    accessibility != up-time

*   fault tolerance

    redundancy/repetition that ensures zero downtime

*   disaster recovery

    plan to restore normal operation

*   scalability

    scale out

    vertical

        resizing compute power (processor or storage)

    horizontal

    cloneing/multiplying resources ()

*   elasticity

    dynamically scale out/scale up or scale in scale down

*   agility

    platform to develop and deploy services rapidly
