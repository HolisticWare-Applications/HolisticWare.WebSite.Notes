OpenCL/CUDA and to run it from a managed code level”.

Cuda
Closed-source GPGPU programming technology from NVIDIA
It’s not just API, but also a set of tools and the name for whole architecture
It’s intended only for Nvidia devices
Tools and SDK are available for free
OpenCL
Free and open standard for parallel computing
Supports different kinds of devices – CPU, GPU, DSP
Tools and SDK are being delivered by a provider of a particular device
The main principle in both technologies is that every program, even that one using the graphics card, needs to be started on CPU. Furthermore, it communicates only with the code launched on the device.
