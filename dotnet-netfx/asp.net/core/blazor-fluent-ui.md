This from a backend dev who recently had to create a UI. I used React + MaterialUI. How does that play into the Tailwind-Bootstrap debate. Are we talking about the same thing, or is React + MaterialUI orthogonal to Tailwind/Bootstrap?


I think it goes like this:

Boostrap = components + utility

Tailwind = utility

MUI/FluentUI = components

(and vanilla bootstrap does not play well with react afaik)
