    *   notes

        *   bunch of rubbish, but good to hear

        *   monolith

            *   modular monolith

        *   microservice[s]

        *   comment

            *   parallelism

            *   problem updating/reloading dlls - "modules"

            *   number of processes = number of entry points - Main[s]

                *   monolith = 1

                    *   1 app (with Main) loads N assemblies/dlls

                *   microservices = N

                    *   microservice app loading N dlls is monolith
