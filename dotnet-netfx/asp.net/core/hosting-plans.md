Look into incorporating and applying for this: https://foundershub.startups.microsoft.com/signup it’s free credits and I’ve never seen someone turned down.



Get a dedicated server from OVH. I pay roughly $24 a month for a server with 32gb Ram, a 240gb SSD and an i7-4790k CPU. Host your own SQL Server if you have licenses or use Postgres. Move onto Azure if and when you make enough money for it to be viable.

AWS App Runner + a tiny RDS PGSQL instance would be in the region of $10 a month.

Talos Linux (Kubernetes) + Hetzner cloud/baremetal https://reclaim-the-stack.com/



smarterasp.net works great.
