Look into incorporating and applying for this: https://foundershub.startups.microsoft.com/signup it’s free credits and I’ve never seen someone turned down.



Get a dedicated server from OVH. I pay roughly $24 a month for a server with 32gb Ram, a 240gb SSD and an i7-4790k CPU. Host your own SQL Server if you have licenses or use Postgres. Move onto Azure if and when you make enough money for it to be viable.
