# Blazor

Blazor = Browser + Razor

Blazor is a single page web app experimental web framework for C#/F# and Razor with HTML built on .NET 
that runs in the browser via WebAssembly.

Blazor runs in any browser, bacause it uses only the latest web standards. No plugins or transpilation needed. 
It runs in the browser on a real .NET runtime (Mono) implemented in WebAssembly that executes normal .NET assemblies. 
It works in older browsers too by falling back to an asm.js based .NET runtime.
Developers author Blazor apps using Razor, HTML and .NET languages like C# or F#.


Blazor will have all the features of a modern web framework, including:

* A component model for building composable UI

* Routing

* Layouts

* Forms and validation

* Dependency injection

* JavaScript interop

* Live reloading in the browser during development

* Server-side rendering

* Full .NET debugging both in browsers and in the IDE

* Rich IntelliSense and tooling

* Ability to run on older (non-WebAssembly) browsers via asm.js

* Publishing and app size trimming
