# SEO Search Engine Optimizations

seo-search-engine-optimizations.md


1.  Use URLs like /blog/blah-blah-blah not blog?id=2137

2.  Use asp-append-version 

    (what the fuck does it have to do with SEO) and some hallucinations about tag helpers that automate the generation 
    of SEO elements like <title> and <meta>

3.  Cache your shit

4.  Use a sitemap. 

    And a hallucination about a sitemap Nuget that doesn't exist.

5.  Use HTTPS

6.  Lazy load your images 

    (no, contrary to what this blogspam claims, you don't need tag helpers for that, <img> element supports 
    `loading="lazy"` natively

7.  Use Schema.NET package to generate JSON-LD schemas

8.  Use env-specific configuration, as if that had anything to do with SEO

9.  Compress your responses with GZip and Brotli (and ZStandard, which this blogspam doesn't mention)

10. Use health checks
