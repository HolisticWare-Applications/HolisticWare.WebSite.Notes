# .NET Aspire

readme.md

Elevator:

Aspire is “Docker Compose without the YAML,” a code-first orchestrator that runs locally, includes built-in observability,
deploys anywhere, and handles your whole stack—not just containers.

Longer:

Aspire lets you describe every part of your app in code: web services, background jobs, databases, queues, caches, and
containers. One command spins everything up on your machine, wiring connection strings, secrets, and ports automatically.
A real-time dashboard powered by OpenTelemetry gives you logs, traces, and metrics out of the box. When you are ready to
ship, the same model publishes to any target such as Kubernetes, Azure Container Apps, or plain VMs with docker, reusing
all the wiring so the app “just works” wherever it runs.

Yes, it can run any container, executable or any code you can write.
