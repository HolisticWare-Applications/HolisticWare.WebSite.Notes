# `var` keyword

var-keyword.md


Personal view/disclaimer:

```
I try really hard, so that my code is inclusive and friendly to:

    *   junior (less experienced) developers

    *   in the cases tooling is not available 

        code repositories in browser, editors w/o intellisense/code-completion support, 
```

*   faster/easier to code - very likely (once you get used to it)

*   faster/easier to read - very unlikely

    *   methods returning something

    *   unusable w/o tooling (compiler)

        *   books

        *   websites

        *   IDE without mouse hoovering
