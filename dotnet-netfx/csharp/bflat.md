bflat is a concoction of 

    *   Roslyn - the "official" C# compiler that produces .NET executables - and 
    
    *   NativeAOT (n√©e CoreRT) - the ahead of time compiler for .NET based on CoreCLR. 
    
Thanks to this, you get access to the latest C# features using the high performance CoreCLR GC and 
native code generator (RyuJIT).
