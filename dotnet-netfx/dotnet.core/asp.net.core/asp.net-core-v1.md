Modern Web - Agility

Faster Development Cycles

	*	Fratures shipped as packages
	*	Framework (even runtime) shipped 
		*	as package
		*	as part of the application
	
More Control

	*	zero day security patches by Microsoft
	*	the same code running in development and production
	*	developer opts into new versions allowing breaking changes
	
Runtime performance

	*	smaller size - faster startup times
	*	lower mamory / higher density (90% reduction)
	*	modular, granular
		*	opt in features needed - only
	*	use raw socket or framework or combination of both
	
Development productivity and low friction

	*	edit code and refresh browser
	*	flexibilty of dynamic environment with power of .net
	*	IDEs
		*	Visual Studio
		*	Visual Studio Code
		*	Monodevelop / Xamarin.Studio
		*	atom
		*	brackets
		*	sublime
		*	emacs
