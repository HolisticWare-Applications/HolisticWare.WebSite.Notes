seems kind of odd. I've been watching this since it was posted, but nobody seems to know. Googling around hasn't 
found anything. The author hasn't posted anything in any of the other projects they contribute to. I've found 
several tweets asking what's up, but zero replies.

It's like the tool has all but silently fallen off the face of the earth and almost nobody is talking about it.

edit: I posted an issue about it here as well https://github.com/0xd4d/iced/issues/130

edit2: Well, looks like they just deleted the issue with no comment ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

seems like someone "politely" asked him to stop working on deobfustactors? i cant see someone abandon such big repo 
with not a single word on reasons.

Apparently 0xd4d's account was also suspended on Twitter.
