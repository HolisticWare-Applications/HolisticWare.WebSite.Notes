    *   http://research.microsoft.com/Pex/

    *   Microsoft Research project
    
    *   Pex generates Unit Tests from hand-written Parameterized Unit Tests through 
        Automated Exploratory Testing based on Dynamic Symbolic Execution.

    Pex automatically produces a small test suite with high code coverage for a .NET program. To this end, Pex performs a systematic program analysis (using dynamic symbolic execution, similar to path-bounded model-checking) to determine test inputs for Parameterized Unit Tests. Pex learns the program behavior by monitoring execution traces. Pex uses a constraint solver to produce new test inputs which exercise different program behavior.
