Long story short, the general requirements to get into data science are so broad as to be almost not useful. The title "data scientist" means a lot of things to a lot of hiring managers and doesn't provide clarity on what the person does on a week to week basis. I know people in my own social network with the title "data scientist" that range in roles and responsibilities from something like Sr. Product Analyst to ML Research Engineer.




_Generally_, most data science roles are some combination of math/statistics, software engineering, and product/business sense. Precise combinations of those 3 distinct disciplines vary greatly from company to company, even industry to industry. (edited)



tree based models then being aware of the limitations of the ‘feature importance’ that they give you is critical, and basically it’s not to be trusted. This article(there is a paper and GitHub as well) explains a little of the problem and offers a solution for evaluating what features are actually contributing to the model prediction.

"Fundamental skills/knowledge like data cleaning and statistics are the foundation for work with data.  You simply cannot perform skills like data science without it.  " https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6460800814825959425

Eric Hulbert on LinkedIn: "There is a lot of good advice out there on the skills needed to work with data.  This is not it.    Fundamental skills/knowledge like data cleaning and statistics are the foundation for work with data.  You simply cannot perform skills like data science without it.    But I believe that some good has come of this article.  The data science community has quickly and uniformly criticized it.    I have always found the data science community to be warm, encouraging, and inviting.  I was a bit worried that would create an atmosphere where charlatans could sell snake oil a bit too easily.  It seems the market has spoken and that is not the case.    I wrote some more about this article at The Analytics Dude and would love if you'd check it out, link in comments.  #datascience "
