SDK Updates
The .NET SDK in this release includes key updates to improve security, dependency management, and build integrity:

NuGetAudit: Now raises warnings for vulnerabilities in transitive dependencies, helping maintain secure projects.
dotnet nuget why: A new command to find out why a transitive package is being used by your project.
MSBuild BuildChecks: Introduced to enforce rules and invariants during builds, similar to Roslyn Analyzers, with new rules for Shared Output Path and Double Write Detection.
