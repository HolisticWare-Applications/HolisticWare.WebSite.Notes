I went into .NET thinking this was a programming language, but it seems I've stumbled upon a mini

```
.NET = The Ecosystem
CLR = JVM
C#, F#, VB, others = Languages
Nuget = npm, maven, etc
dotnet cli = your entry point, SDK, driver, javac, go, etc 
dotnet new = templates
dotnet run = dev time compile and run
dotnet publish = ready up for deploy
```
