looking at the obj/android/assets directory, i see a pdb AND mdb there

is it fine for me just to change the pdb? what is the mdb for?

or, do I have to run the pdb2mdb after changing the pdb?

classic pdb is windows specific

classic mdb is mono specific

portable pdb is cross platform (unified)

Mono 5.0+ish generates portable pdb files.

So it depends. If you're building with say .NET framework or msbuild, you'd be using classic pdb.

i am modifying the dll and pdb in the obj/android/assets directory, and i see there is a mdb there

what does that do?

basically, why is there both types?

what is the pdb for actually? I updated the dll and the pdb, but debugging is still not working

i am looking at the code for pdb2mdb and it seems portable pdb is not supported?
