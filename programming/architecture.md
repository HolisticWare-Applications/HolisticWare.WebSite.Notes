Clean architecture is a solution architectural approach that is 

    designed to encourage clear separation of concerns. 
    
    many benefits to this when done properly, including: 
    
        clarity, 
        simplicity, 
        testibility.

    Despite common misconception, it does not dictate code and project layout, 
    
        does naturally encourage layers to be organised well.
