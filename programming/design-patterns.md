### Creational Patterns

*   Abstract Factory	
    
    Creates an instance of several families of classes
  
*   Builder	

    Separates object construction from its representation
*   Factory Method	

    Creates an instance of several derived classes

*   Prototype	

    A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned

*   Singleton	

    A class of which only a single instance can exist

### Structural Patterns
  
  
*   Adapter	

    Match interfaces of different classes
  
*   Bridge	

    Separates an objectâ€™s interface from its implementation

*   Composite	

    A tree structure of simple and composite objects
  
*   Decorator	

    Add responsibilities to objects dynamically
  
*   Facade

    A single class that represents an entire subsystem

*   Flyweight

    A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing
  
*   Proxy	

    An object representing another object

## Behavioral Patterns

*   Chain of Resp.	

    A way of passing a request between a chain of objects
  
*   Command	

    Encapsulate a command request as an object
  
*   Interpreter	

    A way to include language elements in a program

*   Iterator

	Sequentially access the elements of a collection

*   Mediator	

    Defines simplified communication between classes
  
*   Memento	

    Capture and restore an object's internal state
  
*   Observer

	A way of notifying change to a number of classes

*   State	
  
    Alter an object's behavior when its state changes

*   Strategy	
  
    Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class

    *   https://www.reddit.com/r/dotnet/comments/1cfvyjj/strategy_pattern_explained/

*   Template Method	

    Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass

*   Visitor	

    Defines a new operation to a class without change
