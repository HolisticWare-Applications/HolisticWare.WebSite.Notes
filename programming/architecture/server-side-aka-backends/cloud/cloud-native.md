Cloud native technologies 

    *   empower organizations to build and run scalable applications in modern, dynamic environments such as 
    
        *   public, 
        
        *   private, and 
        
        *   hybrid 
        
        clouds. 
        
    *   examples

        *   Containers, 
        
        *   service meshes, 
        
        *   microservices, 
        
        *   immutable infrastructure, and 
        
        *   declarative APIs 

    *   These techniques enable loosely coupled systems that are 
    
        *   resilient, 
        
        *   manageable, and 
        
        *   observable. 
        
    *   Combined with robust automation, 
    
        *   allow engineers to make high-impact changes frequently and predictably with minimal toil
