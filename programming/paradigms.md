DDD Domain Driven Development




DDD is a software development paradigm that encourages the construction of software by focusing on the requirements of business domains. It is beyond being a plug-and-play architecture pattern. Instead, DDD is a philosophy to how teams discover, define, iterate and implement solutions in shared, business-focused language that is widely used and understood between engineering teams and project stakeholders (or “ubiquitous” language).

Within solution code, DDD encourages modelling domains in a rich, centralised manner that aligns closely to the business requirements, and provides secure and predictable mechanisms to mutate domain state. It advocates for tight definition of bounded logical contexts, how they can be maintained/developed, and how they interact.
