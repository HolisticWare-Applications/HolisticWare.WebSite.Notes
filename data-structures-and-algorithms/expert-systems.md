    *   knowledge base

        *   set of rules

    *    inference engine

        *   is an automated reasoning system

        *   evaluates the current state of the knowledge-base,

        *   applies relevant rules

        *   asserts new knowledge into the knowledge base.

        *   optional

            *   abilities for explanation

                *   ability to explain to a user the chain of reasoning used to arrive at a
                    particular conclusion by tracing back over the firing of rules that resulted
                    in the assertion.[28]

        *   two modes for an inference engine:

            *   forward chaining

            *   backward chaining

*   serializable
