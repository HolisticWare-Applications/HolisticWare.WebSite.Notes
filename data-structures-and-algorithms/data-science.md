Course 1: Kaggle Data Science Micro Courses - These courses are through the kaggle platform and introduce you 
to the basics of python, machine learning and deep learning. I like this course because it can help you to get 
started on data science projects as quickly as possible.

Course 2: The Google Machine Learning Crash Course - This course is through google and can be used with the 
google colab python environment. This course has a video component that is quite informative.
