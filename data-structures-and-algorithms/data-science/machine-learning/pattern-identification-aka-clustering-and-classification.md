# pattern identification (clustering and classification)

pattern-identification-aka-clustering-and-classification.md

Classification and clustering are two methods of pattern identification used in machine learning. 
Although both techniques have certain similarities, the difference lies in the fact that classification 
uses predefined classes in which objects are assigned, while clustering identifies similarities between 
objects, which it groups according to those characteristics in common and which differentiate them from 
other groups of objects. These groups are known as "clusters".
