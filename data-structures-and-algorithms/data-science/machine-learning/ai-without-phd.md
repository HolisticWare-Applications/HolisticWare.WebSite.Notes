When you think of "deep learning" you might think of teams of PhDs with petabytes of data 
and racks of supercomputers. But it turns out that a year of coding, high school math, a 
free GPU service, and a few dozen images is enough to create world-class models. fast.ai 
has made it their mission to make deep learning as accessible as possible, and in this

courses to become an effective deep learning practitioner.
