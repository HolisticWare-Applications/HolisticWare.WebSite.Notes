1. Ensure you can trace the deployed model back to the data that trained it. Model & data metadata is a must

2. Discuss with the team how solving a "model bug" is different from solving normal software bugs. Usually 
   more effort

3. Benchmark your models inference speed (training speed != Inf speed and most places report training speed)

4. Talk to your UX team about model failures and how that impact user experience and how can design and good 
   copy help with that

5. Ensure business understands the metrics you're using - in fact, cose and report on a metric that allows 
   them to make trade offs. E.g. ROC curves over accuracy give business more control (3/n)
