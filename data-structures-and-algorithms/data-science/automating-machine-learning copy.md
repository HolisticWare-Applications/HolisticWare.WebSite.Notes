automated machine learning 

*   Preprocess and clean the data.

*   Select and construct appropriate features.

*   Select an appropriate model family.

*   Optimize model hyperparameters.

*   Postprocess machine learning models.

*   Critically analyze the results obtained.



Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of 
TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. 
Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to doing good research.



TensorFlow has a Python API which is not that hard, but Keras made really easy to get into Deep 
Learning for lots of people. It should be noted that Keras is now officially a part of Tensorflow:


Module: tf.contrib.keras | TensorFlow

Great. Now we know what is Keras and AutoML, letâ€™s combine them. Auto-Keras is an open source 
software library for automated machine learning. Auto-Keras provides functions to automatically 
search for architecture and hyperparameters of deep learning models.
