```
People generally try to market new technologies by telling you their upsides, not their downsides.

But Microsoft’s AI CEO is saying AI is going to take everybody’s job. And Sam Altman is saying that AI will wipe out 
entire categories of jobs. ANd Matt Shumer is saying that AI is currently like Covid in January 2020—as in, “kind of 
under the radar, but about to kill millions of people”.

I legitimately feel like I am going insane when I hear AI technologists talk about the technology. They’re supposed to 
market it. But they’re instead saying that it is going to leave me a poor, jobless wretch, a member of the “permanent
underclass,” as the meme on Twitter goes. Half the videos and blog posts I see about new models boil down to somebody
running it through a benchmark, then saying “chat we’re cooked, might as well end it all now.” This isn’t just a strange
way of marketing a product, it is a completely psychotic one.
