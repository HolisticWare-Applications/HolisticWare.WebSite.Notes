*   NumSharp 

    *   Pure C# implementation of NumPy

*   Numpy.NET 

    *   C# bindings for NumPy - a fundamental library for scientific computing, machine learning and AI

*   Keras.NET

    *   high-level neural networks API, written in C# with Python Binding and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano.


*   ICSharpCore Jupyter kernel in C# .NET Core which is the standard interface for SciSharp STACK.

*   SharpCV A image library combines OpenCV and NumSharp together. SharpCV returns Mat object with NDArray supported.
