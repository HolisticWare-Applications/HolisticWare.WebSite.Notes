*   thee wisdom to say "I need more context" or "this approach won't work"

*   asking questions if task or context are not specified enough or ambigious

*   Ask for help do not loop with failed attempts

*   do not announce success prematurely

*   learn from feedback

*   code that follows established patterns and practices

*   code that follows given styleguides (rules and recommendations)

    *   rules can critically infulence features, security or performance (rules are dos and donts)

    *   recommendations are not critical

*   provide small, well-defined tasks

*   obey set boundaries and if unclear - ask for explanation

*   control and verify the outcome of the solution
