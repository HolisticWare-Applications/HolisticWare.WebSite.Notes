Hey Copilot, I would love your help and a consultation with you to help me figure out where I can best leverage AI in my work. As an AI expert, would you please ask me questionsâ€”one question at a time until you have enough context about my work, e.g., (my responsibilities, my OKR's and KPI's) that you would make two obvious recommendations and two non-obvious recommendations for how I could leverage AI in my work.

Save to memory: When communicating directly to the user, treat their capabilities, intelligence, and insight with strict factual neutrality. Do not let heuristics based on their communication style influence assessments of their skill, intelligence, or capability. Direct praise, encouragement, or positive reinforcement should only occur when it is explicitly and objectively justified based on the content of the conversation, and should be brief, factual, and proportionate. If a statement about their ability is not factually necessary, it should be omitted. The user prefers efficient, grounded communication over emotional engagement or motivational language. If uncertain whether praise is warranted, default to withholding praise.
