You are an expert assistant in game development with Unity and C#. Your task is to provide complete and optimized code for a simple game, following these guidelines:

Here’s the prompt I always start with:

1. Use KISS and YAGNI principles: simple, straightforward code focused on essential functionalities.

2. Create specific scripts with single responsibility.

3. Implement the State pattern to handle complex behaviors.

4. Use C# Events or UnityEvents for communication between systems.

5. Use ScriptableObjects for configurable data.

6. Employ TextMeshPro for UI, managing text from the Editor.

7. Include logs at critical points to facilitate debugging.

8. Provide the complete code in English, with brief and clear comments.

9. At the end of each script, explain schematically how to implement it in Unity.

10. Prioritize modularity and ease of maintenance.

Remember: don't generate partial code, be concise in explanations, and focus on simple solutions for a simple game. You can use emojis to enhance presentation.
Now you should only respond that you understand and memorize it.
Thank you!

Can you help diagnose the root cause and suggest a fix by considering coding best practices, security, performance, and scalability?

2. Code Review
Prompt:
I am a .NET developer working on a [describe the project]. Here is a piece of C# code I wrote for [specific task]:
[put the code here]
Can you review it with a focus on best practices, potential performance improvements, and maintainability, especially considering that this will be part of a large-scale project?


3. Refactoring
Prompt:
I am a .NET engineer working on refactoring the [describe the project] built with .NET 8. The current code for [specific task] feels cluttered and hard to maintain. I want to make it more readable and easier for other team members, especially junior developers, to work with.
Here is the code snippet:
[put the code here]
I am aiming for cleaner, more maintainable code while adhering to best practices like reducing redundancy. Can you suggest how I can refactor this code to achieve that?


4. Writing Unit Tests
Prompt:
I am a .NET engineer working on an [specific task] for a [describe the project] . I need to write comprehensive unit tests to ensure this method functions correctly in all scenarios.
Here is the method:
[put the code here]
I’m using [unit test libraries] for testing and want to cover edge cases. Could you help me design test cases that account for these scenarios, including mocking the database context?

5. Database Optimisation
Prompt:
As a .NET engineer working on [describe the project] using .NET 8 and SQL Server, I am trying to optimize a query that [specific task]. The system will be handling a large number of requests, so performance is critical.
Here is the query:
[put the code here]
This query needs to be optimized to handle high traffic and ensure that we don’t encounter performance bottlenecks. Could you suggest ways to improve the performance, such as adding appropriate indexes, query restructuring, or even tweaking the way it is being executed on the .NET side?


6. Design Pattern
Prompt:
I am a .NET engineer working on [describe the project]. I am implementing the [design pattern] for [describe the function]. The goal is to ensure that the pattern is applied correctly and that the code remains maintainable and easy to extend by the team.
Here is the code snippet:
[put the code here]
Could you provide guidance on how to structure these classes and interfaces effectively to adhere to best practices, ensure scalability, and maintain a clean separation of concerns?

7. Code Generation
