# ETL Extract Transform Load

*   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load

*   Extraction 

    *   process of retrieving data from one or more sources
    
        *   online
        
        *   on-premises
        
        *   legacy
        
        *   SaaS
        
        *   others. 

    *   After the retrieval, or extraction, is complete, the data is loaded into a staging area.

*   Transformation

    *   involves taking that data, cleaning it, and putting it into a common format, 
    
    can be stored in a targeted database, data store, data warehouse, or data lake. 
    
    Cleaning typically involves 
    taking out duplicate, incomplete, or obviously erroneous records.

Loading

Loading is the process of inserting that formatted data into the target database, data store, data warehouse, or 
data lake.


ETL use cases
ETL is an important way to bring all relevant data together in one place to make it actionable—to analyze it and enable executives, managers, and other stakeholders to make informed business decisions based on it. ETL is commonly used to do the following:

Data warehousing

A data warehouse is a database where data from various sources is combined so that it can be collectively analyzed for business purposes. ETL is often used to move data to a data warehouse.

Machine learning and artificial intelligence

Machine learning (ML) is a way of making sense of data without explicitly programming analytical models. Instead, the system learns from data using artificial-intelligence techniques. ETL can be used to move the data into a single location for ML purposes.

Marketing data integration

Marketing data integration involves moving all your marketing data—such as customer, social networking, and web-analytics data—into one place, so you can analyze it and develop future plans. ETL is used to collect and prepare marketing data.

IoT data integration

IoT is the collection of connected devices capable of gathering and transmitting data through sensors embedded in hardware. IoT devices can include factory equipment, network servers, smartphones, or a broad range of other machines—even wearables and implanted devices. ETL helps move data from multiple IoT sources to a single place where you can analyze it.

Database replication

Database replication takes data from your source databases—like Oracle, Cloud SQL for MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or others—and copies it into your cloud data warehouse. This can be a one-time operation or an ongoing process as your data is updated, and ETL can be used to replicate the data.

Cloud migration

Companies are moving their data and applications from on-premises to the cloud to save money, make their applications more scalable, and secure their data, and ETL is commonly used to run these migrations.
