    Yeah this should be upvoted. There are other ideas floating around and Pash is good for looking at this and saying RAG isn't the answer but maybe RAG + something is. The industry, on the bleeding edge, is starting to talk about this publicly so maybe it is a thing. Data seems to indicate that there are augmentations at least for RAG if not a wholesale swap out. These things look to optimize communication and memory between LLMs and RAG specifically so keep that in mind. I was listening to it being addressed on Latent Space with a guy from Chroma ...this is his take https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIbIZ_Bxl_g

    At 36:00 even AST is mentioned. Cline has a AST tool and that itâ€™s not used all that often and might not be all that necessary. Cuz most of the time imports are at the top of the file that you can find where some reference is coming from.

I wonder if LSP tooling is more important for c# than typescript for agentic coding.

Typescript the LLM can find the reference easily from the imports at the top of the file.



C# has usings at the top of the file but these are only namespaces. Harder to find the reference
