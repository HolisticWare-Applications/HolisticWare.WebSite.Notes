                *   maintains architecture, reviews code, sets boundaries

            *   PasteMax
            
                *   transforms code into context for aistudio (Gemini 2.5 Pro)

        *   workflow

            1.  Describe the project in Gemini 2.5 Pro

            2.  Get a plan (PRD)

            3.  Run the PRD through Task-master AI

            4.  Feed Cursor one short, well-defined task at a time

            5.  Return code to Gemini 2.5 Pro for review using PasteMax

            6.  Gemini assigns tasks to Cursor

            7.  human just monitor everything and run tests

    *   other options

        *   Roo Code

            architecture and code indexing, weaker on complex implementation

            excellent for small/medium projects, struggles with lots of code reruns
