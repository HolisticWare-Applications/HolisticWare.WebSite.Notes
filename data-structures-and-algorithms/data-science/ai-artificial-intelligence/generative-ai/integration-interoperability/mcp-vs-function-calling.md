MCP (Model Context Protocol) and function calling are both methods used in conjunction with Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable them to interact with external systems and tools. Function calling focuses on the LLM's ability to trigger specific functions or APIs based on user prompts. MCP, on the other hand, provides a more standardized and scalable infrastructure for managing and orchestrating these interactions, often involving multiple tools and services. 
Function Calling:

    LLM-centric:
    Function calling is primarily driven by the LLM's ability to recognize when a specific function or API needs to be invoked to fulfill a user's request. 

Direct invocation:
The LLM directly calls the function, passing in the necessary parameters based on its understanding of the prompt. 
Examples:
An LLM might use function calling to retrieve information from a database, send an email, or make a reservation. 
Strengths:
Simple, fast prototyping, good for straightforward tasks. 
Limitations:
Can be less reliable, especially with complex tasks or when multiple tools are involved. 

MCP (Model Context Protocol):

    Standardized infrastructure: MCP provides a standardized way for LLMs to discover, access, and interact with various tools and services. 

Orchestration: It focuses on orchestrating the interaction between LLMs and tools, ensuring reliable and scalable execution. 
Beyond function calling: MCP can handle complex workflows involving multiple tools, authentication, and authorization, while function calling is typically limited to single function invocations. 
Examples: An LLM might use MCP to coordinate a series of actions across different services, such as booking a flight, hotel, and rental car based on a user's travel plans. 
Strengths: Reliable, scalable, secure, good for complex enterprise applications. 
Limitations: Can be more complex to set up and manage than simple function calling. 

In essence: Function calling is like the LLM directly asking a friend for help, while MCP is like giving the LLM a control panel with access to a whole network of tools and services. 
Relationship: MCP builds upon the concept of function calling. It leverages function calling to enable LLMs to interact with tools, but it adds a layer of standardization, orchestration, and security. MCP doesn't replace function calling; it provides a more robust and scalable infrastructure for using it. 
Key Differences:
Feature
	
Function Calling
	
MCP
Focus
