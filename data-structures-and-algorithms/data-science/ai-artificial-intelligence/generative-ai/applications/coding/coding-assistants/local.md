Local Alternatives for the Privacy-Conscious

For developers who require offline capabilities or wish to maintain the "local-only" privacy model of IntelliCode, several third-party alternatives have matured in 2025:

Continue: An open-source extension for VS Code that allows you to swap cloud models for local ones like Qwen2.5-Coder or Llama 3.1.
Tabby: A self-hosted AI coding assistant that specializes in deterministic tab-autocomplete.
BroPilot: A specialized extension for Visual Studio that connects the IDE to local LLM backends.
VS Code AI Toolkit: Microsoft's own extension for downloading and running ONNX-optimized models locally.
