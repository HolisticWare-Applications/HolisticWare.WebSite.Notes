        *   AI Model

            *   lifecycle stges

                *   training

                    *   analysis of relationships

                    *   encoding relationships into model weights connecting artificial neurons

                    *   input (feed) large number of labeled data based on patterns

                        *   alters weights

                *   inferencing

                    *   real-time data

                        *   prompts

                        *   additional data (documents)

                    *   model generalizes

                    *   model is tested/challenged with unseen data

                        *   creates prediction - probabilistic

                    *   incures high costs of inferencing

                        *   scale
                        
                            *   number of requests when models are served publicly

                        *   model lifecycle 90% is inferencing

                *   goal - to produce result - actionable result


*   RAG vs Fine-Tuning vs Prompt Engineering: Optimizing AI Models

    *   RAG

    *   Fine Tuniing

    *   Propmpt Engineering

        *   input (prompt) is processed through series of layers - attention layers/mechanisms

            *   each focuses on different aspect of a prompt

        *   different input (prompts) can alter output (result/answer)

        *   no infrastructure changes

        *   immediate results/responses

        *   trial and error

        *   limited to

            *   existing knowledge

            *   cutoff date
