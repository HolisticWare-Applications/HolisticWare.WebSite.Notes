In MSTY, "model instructions" refer to the guidelines and configurations that dictate how a language model should operate within the platform. These instructions can include:

Model Selection: Choosing which language model to use, such as Llama-2, GPT-4, or other supported models 1.
Configuration Settings: Adjusting parameters like tokenizers, GPU settings, and other technical specifications to optimize model performance 1.
Usage Guidelines: Defining how the model should be used, including privacy settings, offline functionality, and integration with other tools or APIs 1.
These instructions help ensure that the model operates efficiently and securely, tailored to the user's specific needs and preferences.
