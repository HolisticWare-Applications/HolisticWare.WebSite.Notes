LLM reasoning models are large language models (LLMs) designed to perform complex reasoning tasks beyond simple pattern recognition and text generation. They are trained to break down problems, consider various possibilities, and arrive at logical conclusions, similar to how humans think. These models are capable of deductive, inductive, abductive, and analogical reasoning, though their performance varies depending on the complexity and novelty of the task.

Key aspects of reasoning in LLMs:
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting:
A technique where the model is encouraged to show its intermediate steps of reasoning before providing the final answer, improving performance on complex tasks. 
Agentic frameworks:
These frameworks, like ReAct, combine reasoning and action to enable the model to develop plans and interact with external tools. 
Self-reflection:
Some models incorporate self-reflection mechanisms, allowing them to analyze their reasoning process and correct errors.

Types of Reasoning in LLMs:
Deductive Reasoning: Applying general rules to specific cases.
Inductive Reasoning: Identifying patterns from examples and predicting trends.
Abductive Reasoning: Finding the most likely explanation based on incomplete information.
Analogical Reasoning: Finding similarities between different situations or datasets.

Applications:
Reasoning LLMs are crucial for various applications, including:
Complex problem-solving (e.g., solving puzzles, mathematical problems, coding tasks). 
Developing intelligent agents for tasks like planning, scheduling, and meeting summarization. 
Enhancing dialogue systems, question-answering, recommendation systems, and text summarization. 
Improving the safety and controllability of LLMs by incorporating alignment-based post-training.
