# Copilot Bring Your Own Language Model

copilot-bring-your-own-language-model.md


GitHub Copilot can be configured to work with Ollama and other local language models. You need to use the "Bring Your Own Language Model" feature in VS Code and point it to your Ollama instance. 
Here's how you can set it up:
1. Install and Run Ollama:
Download and install Ollama and ensure it's running locally. You can then pull and run models like Code Llama or similar using Ollama commands. 
2. Configure VS Code:
In VS Code, navigate to settings and enable the "Bring Your Own Language Model" feature. 
3. Provide the Endpoint:
You'll need to specify the Ollama server's endpoint (usually http://localhost:11434 or similar) in the Copilot settings, according to GitHub. 
4. Authentication:
You'll still need to authenticate with GitHub to use Copilot, even when using a local model. 
5. Choose Your Model:
In the Copilot settings, you can then select from the list of models available via your Ollama server, according to Reddit. 
Important Considerations:
Content Filtering:
While you're using a local model, some content filtering might still be happening on Microsoft's servers, according to GitHub. 
Network Access:
While your code generation happens locally, Copilot still needs network access for authentication and potentially other features, according to Reddit. 
Performance:
Performance can vary based on your hardware and the model you're using. Having sufficient RAM is crucial for handling larger models, according to bjornpeters.com. 
Alternatives:
If you want a truly offline experience, you might explore other options like Llama.cpp or other tools that allow for completely local model usage, according to Reddit.
