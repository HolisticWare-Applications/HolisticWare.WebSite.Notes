        Best models
        Aider works best with these models, which are skilled at editing code:

            Gemini 2.5 Pro
            DeepSeek R1 and V3
            Claude 3.7 Sonnet
            OpenAI o3, o4-mini and GPT-4.1

        free models
            Aider works with a number of free API providers:

            OpenRouter offers free access to many models, with limitations on daily usage.

            Googleâ€™s Gemini 2.5 Pro Exp works very well with aider.

        Most of the cli tools just wrap an LLM, but don't give it access to the data it needs to be useful. Aider is an exception of course - it gives great results because it feeds the LLM your source files.

    brew install ollama

    brew install --cask ollama
