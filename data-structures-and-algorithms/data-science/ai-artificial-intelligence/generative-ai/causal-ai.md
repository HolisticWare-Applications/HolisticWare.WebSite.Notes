Casual ML is the anti-thesis of LLM's.

Causal is small data intelligence, correctness from rules or small number of examples.

LLMs is intelligence derived from associations, emergence from web scale sample sets.

If you are talking grounding in LLM's that is XAI; transparency, interpretable, justification.

LLMs and causal inference come from different paradigms. But I'm curious about how causal methods might support things like alignment, robustness, or counterfactual reasoning
