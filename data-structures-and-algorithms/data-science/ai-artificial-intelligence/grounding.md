# Grounding LMs

LLM grounding is the process of enriching large language models with domain-specific information, enabling them to understand and produce responses that are not only accurate but also contextually relevant to specific industries or organizational needs.

In generative AI, grounding is the ability to connect model output to verifiable sources of information. If you provide models with access to specific data sources, then grounding tethers their output to these data and reduces the chances of inventing content.

Grounding data comes from source data that contains information about topics not covered in the model's initial training data. Grounding data is combined with the user query to form the prompt that's sent to the large language model in the context of a specific inference call
