*   AI artificial intelligence

    *   not new concept 

    *   subsection of computer science

    *   term was created by John McCarthy in 1956. 

        defined it as “the science and engineering of making intelligent machines”. 

    *   AI is any intelligence, characteristically human, demonstrated by a machine or computer 
        in solving a problem it is given. AI is classed into two categories; general and narrow AI.

    *   General AI systems possess all the features of human intelligence 

        i.e. it can perform any task a human can, or even better. This ranges from solving problems, 
        recognizing faces, sounds and objects to understanding languages. 

    *   Narrow AI has the ability to perform only dedicated tasks e.g. Facebook’s facial recognition 
        capability, the image classification feature on Pinterest. For AI to work, it needs access to 
        information that would increase its chance of performing its duties.

*   MACHINE LEARNING

    *   phrase was created by Arthur Samuel in 1959. 

    *   involves training a machine using a large amount of data and algorithms that enable it 
        to make a forecast about something. Without machine learning, 
        AI can still function but it would require inputting many lines of code with particular instructions 
        to carry out a task and this process can be complex and cumbersome. 

    *   information is fed, the machine learns the patterns and trends, it adjusts and improves.

    *   system with this capability gets increasingly better at performing a certain function. 
    
    *   Voice recognition systems such as Siri, Google Maps, Google Search, music streaming services are 
        examples of machine learning models where our continuous interaction with the programs allows them to 
        make recommendations or suggestions based on information it gathers. So, Google Search is able to make 
        suggestions based on our previous search histories. Music streaming services are able to make recommendations 
        by comparing the musical taste with other users.

*   Deep learning

    *   subset of Machine Learning. 
    
    *   works using the Artificial Neural Network (ANN). 
    
    *   ANN is a system based on how neurons in the brains connect and function. 
    
    *   The network is designed to continuously analyze data and learn a structure similar to how humans reason 
        and draw conclusions. The neural network has discrete layers and connections to each other; each layer is 
        designed to learn a particular task.

    *   This layering is where the name “deep learning” is derived. 
    
    *   An example of this is a self-driving car. Each layer of this model would learn a certain task such as 
        recognizing a pedestrian or identifying street signs. 
        A combination of these different tasks will enable it to navigate the streets. In the health sector, 
        deep learning has been successful in identifying biomarkers in cancer diagnosis.


Artificial Intelligence is a generic term for intelligence displayed by machines. Machine Learning (ML) is one way to attain AI and deep learning is an advancement of machine learning. ML and DL require a large volume of data to work with. This data can be used from the Internet of Things (IoT) which is the growing network of physical devices e.g. smartphones, appliances, vehicles, machines that are accessible via the internet.

The more devices are connected, the more information is collected. This information can be assimilated and used to make predictions in different sectors as companies and businesses can make decisions based on real-time information making them more efficient and consumer friendly. Example: tailoring products to suit consumer purchasing habits, scheduling preventive maintenance, adjusting a manufacturing process to meet demand, identifying industry trends etc.

    *   large numbers provide data for AI algorithms
