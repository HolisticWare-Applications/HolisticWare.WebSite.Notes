# Data Science 

data-science.md

2 general tracks within data science: 

    *   analytics 
    
    *   engineering. 
    
Some say for the former credentialing and  education is more important but only for signaling purposes.


premise that data analytics or data engineering are part of data science is incorrect. 

are three fields that intersect at data:

*   Data science

    *   regression + statistics

*   data engineering

    *   movement of data + infrastructure

*   data analytics 

    *   modeling + reporting/analysis

*   these 3 get confused a lot

*   super related. 



*   companies are still developing their frameworks for these things. 

*   startups just hire one “data” person and they do all of them at the beginning. 


great blog post on this https://veekaybee.github.io/2019/02/13/data-science-is-different/




*   for many the title "data scientist" isn't very informative as it can mean anything from 
"deep learning research engineer" to "business analyst", depending on the role and company. 

I draw a lot of inspiration from others in the space and I'd agree with this tweet:
