Python environment tools

various tools involved with Python environments:

*   pip
    
    The Python package manager that installs and updates packages. It's installed with Python 3.9+ by default (unless 
    you are on a Debian-based OS; install python3-pip in that case).

*   venv

    Allows you to manage separate package installations for different projects and is installed with Python 3 by default
    (unless you are on a Debian-based OS; install python3-venv in that case)

*   conda

    Installed with Miniconda. It can be used to manage both packages and virtual environments. Generally used for data
    science projects.
