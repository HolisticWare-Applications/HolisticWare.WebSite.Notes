# Feynman's teaching technique

Prof. Feynman: If you cannot explain something in simple terms, you don't understand it.

 

Feynman's teaching technique, in his own words:

 

1.  Pick a topic you want to understand and start studying it

2.  Pretend to teach the topic to a classroom
    Explain to someone unfamiliar to the topic, like child, at their level of understanding
    Use simple language

3.  Identify gaps in your understanding
    What was not understood by non-experts

4.  Return to the literature for better understandiing
    Go back to the books when you get stuck
    Simplify and use analogies!




Eric Weinstein does not like this saying. His perfect example of difficult things that you can understand but might be unable to explain to even a graduate student is Space manifolds in Topology. 

Albert Einstein also believes you should be able to explain it to a little child if you understand it

 

So here lies the conundrum, do you think all matters are explainable to all ages?






I tend to think that Kids and animals are smarter than we allow for.  If one has the capacity to hold the basics of the concepts, then yes you should be able to explain it no matter the age.  I had someone be surprised that I was actually reasoning with my 18-month-old daughter.  I also read an account from a father, where his daughter could not explain something to him.  She ended up saying that she needed more words to explain it.  That is grasping not only the problem (verbal deficiency), but also the correct solution.  

 

So if it can be broken down to their level, then yes... it can be explained to them.
