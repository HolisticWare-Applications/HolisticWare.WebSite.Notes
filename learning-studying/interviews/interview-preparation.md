#### **Understand the Job Description**
- Review the job posting carefully.
- Identify key skills, qualifications, and responsibilities.
- Match your experience and achievements to the role.

#### **Prepare Your Stories (STAR Method)**
Use the **STAR** method to structure answers to behavioral questions:
- **S**ituation: Set the context.
- **T**ask: Describe your responsibility.
- **A**ction: Explain what you did.
- **R**esult: Share the outcome (quantify if possible).

*Example:*  
"Tell me about a time you handled a difficult situation at work."

> *Situation:* "In my previous role, a key client was unhappy with a delayed project delivery."  
> *Task:* "I was tasked with regaining their trust and completing the project successfully."  
> *Action:* "I scheduled a meeting to listen to their concerns, revised the timeline with transparency, and provided weekly updates."  
> *Result:* "The client not only stayed with us but increased their contract by 20% the following year."

#### **Practice Common Interview Questions**
- "Tell me about yourself."
- "Why do you want to work here?"
- "What are your strengths and weaknesses?"
- "Where do you see yourself in 5 years?"
- "Describe a challenge and how you overcame it."

#### **Prepare Questions to Ask the Interviewer**
Ask thoughtful questions like:
- "What does success look like in this role?"
- "How would you describe the team culture?"
- "What are the biggest challenges the team is facing right now?"
- "What opportunities for growth or development are available?"

#### **Logistics & Appearance**
- Confirm the interview time, format (in-person, video, phone), and location.
- Test your tech (camera, mic, internet) for virtual interviews.
- Choose professional attire (even for virtual interviews).
- Plan to arrive 10–15 minutes early.

### **3. After the Interview**
